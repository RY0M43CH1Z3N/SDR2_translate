SDR2_translate
==============

This is the attempt to create the translation GUI for Super Danganronpa 2 PSP game.

The whole project is written in python with Tk as a GUI engine. I know it's ugly, but i'm trying to make it as cross-platform as possible.
As an IDE i'm using a Rapyd-tk, but only for the main file, SDR2_Translate.py, because otherwise this thing is awful, but for GUI design... dunno, i like it.

Some classes, e.g. GimFile, can be used as a stand-alone modules.

For now, the code is quite slow, ugly and lacks both common sense and comments. Also, the naming sense is quite bad imho. 
I'll try to make it better after finishing the initial work, especially those stand-alone modules.

If you want to try to translate the game, read the TRANSLATE_README.txt

For now, i'm too lazy/stupid to implement .cpk packer/unpacker, so you'll need to use a CRI Packed File Maker, which can be found in Google.

Mail me if you have smth to say ;)
